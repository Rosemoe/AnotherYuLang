## AnotherYuLang
### Introduction
AnotherYuLang is a third-party iyu language support library.    
This purpose of this project is to run iyu instantly and parse iyu code into Java source code instead of using text analyzing line by line as official version does, which can bring better performance to this language.    
This project will also integrate apk builder to pack Android applications.   
### Modules
* yulang-parser
This is a simple parser for iyu made by ANTLR.   
* yulang-shell
This is a simple iyu runner without compiling them.
